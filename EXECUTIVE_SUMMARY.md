# SaveX - Executive Summary

## One-Liner
**SaveX makes cross-border money transfers 95% cheaper than Western Union using smart contracts, DEX aggregation, and subscription packages on Stellar blockchain.**

## The Problem
Global remittances are a **$600B annual market**, but traditional services charge **3-7% fees** ($37B wasted yearly) with 3-5 day delays. Current crypto solutions lack rate locking, fee optimization, and user-friendly UX.
